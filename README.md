The dataset consists of 12 measurements on 6,497 samples of white and red styles of Vinho Verde wines. There are NO missing data. Descriptions of each variable are below.

| #Variable | #Description |
| :---: | :---: |	
|fixed_acidity |	Naturally occurring acid, higher levels yield fresher or more tart wines |
|volatile_acidity |	Acid produced during fermentation, leads to unpleasant aromas |
|citric_acid |	Inexpensive supplement to boost total acidity|
|residual_sugar | Remaining sugar after fermentation or sometimes added, higher levels yield sweeter wines|
|chlorides |		Saltiness, often just barely detectable|
|pH	 |	Higher levels make wines taste softer, inversely related to acidity|
|alcohol |		Produced from yeast and sugar during fermentation, higher levels associated with more complex wines|
|density	 |	Lower for "dry" wines, higher for sweet wines free_sulfur_dioxide, |
|total_sulfur_dioxide |		Antibiotics/antioxidants to protect wine and sanitize wineries; detectable as pungent odor at higher levels and responsible for label “contains sulfites”|
|sulphates |		Potassium sulphate used to lower pH, raise acidity and intensify color in red wines|
|quality	 |	Median of ratings on a 0 to 10 (poor to excellent) scale from three or more experts who participated in blind tastings|
|style |		Red or white|
